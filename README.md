# Statistics-Summary
### Importance of Statistics in Data Science
>> As we know that Data Science is the study of data in different forms to make healthy assumptions about behaviours and tendencies and to make these assumptions the information needs to be organised according to the concepts of statistics so that the study becomes easy and hence the findings become more accurate.
>> When the data is big and unorganised, statistics plays a powerful role in that situation. When a company uses statistics to find insights, it makes the tedious task look minimalist and easy in front of the big and buffer information that was provided earlier.
